This is a simple social app that users can register and login find friends and talk to them. The first time users log in, they will be asked to provide more specific information about themselves. Then a built in algorithm will try to find the most matched people for them based on the information they provided (hobbies, education, age, location, nationality, gender).

Users can then send a friend request, once it is approved, that user gets added to the friendslist. User can then send messages. All the message history are saved in database.
Message sending is not real time, but it is DOM style and controlled by JavaScript.

Users can also upload a profile picture, the picture will then gets renamed to match user's username, which is unique.
